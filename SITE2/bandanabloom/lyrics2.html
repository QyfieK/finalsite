						<h2>Tidal Waves 2</h2>
						<p>
Words like tidal waves will sweep me off my quiet caves and<br>
Drown my fireplace and taunt me while I lie awake<br>
The moon's got a grudge<br>
It's trying to hold me<br>
But my hands won't budge<br>
As I coax 'em out slowly<br><br>
My words are spurted perfect<br>
I'm a surgeon with a scalpel working 'til I've heard precision<br>
It's inertia and a balance of boredom and annoyance at my past work<br>
I'm scared of it<br>
And all these fucking people see me as my first experiment so<br>
Back on my bullshit like an addict relapsing<br>
I'm Earl how I act like lateral passing<br>
My passion back with it having been tattered and blackened<br>
You feel what I'm saying no matter if it's fact or I'm capping<br>
High school ass like flatulence splattering<br>
Lathering it on the bathroom walls until its plastered in<br>
Last year had me acting like a rat in a lab and<br>
This year found out I was discharging battery acid<br>
Had to throw out my fruit snacks<br>
Get my old groove back<br>
New name, Mr. Bloom only speaks true facts<br>
Maybe<br>
Cause I stay confusing clueless cats<br>
And everybody already fucking knew that<br><br>
Words like tidal waves will sweep me off my quiet caves and<br>
Drown my fireplace and taunt me while I lie awake<br>
The moon's got a grudge<br>
It's trying to hold me<br>
But my hands won't budge<br>
As I coax 'em out slowly<br><br>
And I don't get the stress and emphasis on meant to be identity<br>
All my fucking friends were meant as entities and that's the end of it<br>
Concept is elementary like jotting rhetoric into your head correct to fit it in a song, bruh<br>
It's coming up my head erects an S ahead a monka<br>
Slipped through the cracks like ass goalies and hockey pucks<br>
Cath told me<br>
I knew one wave was not enough<br>
Got this shit banging, call it potty fuck<br>
And I don't ride waves, I'm okay with the tide shifts<br>
Leave 'em eyes dazed, wide gaze, hidden eyelids<br>
All these tired days, skies rain, now my grays turned vibrant<br>
No precipitation 'sides flakes from my iced wrist<br>
And fuck approval from the older me I'll soon be older than<br>
I'll sprint ahead of him like mortal rodents in a cobra's den<br>
Slithering and shivering, he know his flow was colder then<br>
So hit me in my DMs if you know who got a coat to lend<br><br>
Words like tidal waves will sweep me off my quiet caves and<br>
Drown my fireplace and taunt me while I lie awake<br>
The moon's got a grudge<br>
It's trying to hold me<br>
But my hands won't budge<br>
As I coax 'em out slowly<br><br>
Words like tidal waves will sweep me off my quiet caves and<br>
Drown my fireplace and taunt me while I lie awake<br>
The moon's got a grudge<br>
It's trying to hold me<br>
But my hands won't budge<br>
As I coax 'em out slowly</p>
