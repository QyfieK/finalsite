						<h2>Letter For My Freshman Self</h2>
						<p>
[Verse 1]<br>
Yeah<br>
Dear Max<br>
Your letter found me safe in good health<br>
I’m glad you wrote I saw your photos you don’t look well<br>
I remember that resentment feelin like you’re set up you up to fail<br>
Or else some doubt don’t have to spell it out I kinda could tell<br>
I hear the anxiousness it’s in the way your phrasing is<br>
I hear the hate towards the way that you’re complacent with<br>
Going through the motions never posting you stretched paper thin<br>
But I could tell you what’s to come and what to makе of it<br>
You gon’ spend the summer lookin at thе clock a lot<br>
The surgeries ensure you really<br>
Never got to toss<br>
Ass your shit in organized piles<br>
You just wander off<br>
Lost in your thoughts til it dawns on you you’re proper lost<br>
You try and find yourself in music same as ever<br>
And then by the power of circumstance a bunch of other people<br>
At this school party hear about what you’d been making<br>
And that’s what gonna finally start a fucking conversation<br>

<br>
[Hook]<br>
Is it nicer down the road?<br>
Is it brighter as we go?<br>
Is it nicer down the road?<br>
Is it brighter as we go?<br>
<br>
[Verse 2]
New friends appear like siblings that were long lost<br>
You watch ‘em snicker while you fib to all the mall cops<br>
Watchin your walls dissolve quicker than a frog hops<br>
You’ve been a new you ever since the ball dropped<br>
Sad recollections fade ‘til you forget to fret<br>
So it’s atonement this the future you were meant to get<br>
And while the laughs sound in the background you resurrect<br>
All of that ambition you convinced yourself you left for dead<br>
So let yourself enjoy your passable performances<br>
At play practice stay mad turning homework in<br>
Mic recording vocals writers block is all but over with<br>
Jot whats on your noggin ‘til you poppin à la soda fizz<br>
No second thought to give cause fortune on your side now<br>
Pencil tip it never slips<br>
No print to tint in white-out<br>
See the light with dry eyes there’s nothing much to cry ‘bout<br>
If the sky caves in we’d still enjoy the night out<br>
<br>
[Hook]<br>
Is it nicer down the road?<br>
Is it brighter as we go?<br>
Is it nicer down the road?<br>
Is it brighter as we go?<br>
<br>

[Verse 3]<br>
By the spring you’re gonna wanna fucking kill yourself<br>
No way to sugarcoat it you ‘gon wanna kill yourself<br>
Built a foundation and you blinked and all the pillars fell<br>
Story doesn’t go on you’re stuck in<br>
Fucking filler hell<br>
You had tried your best the world changed around you and you lost a little hearing<br>
We were taking it for granted<br>
Judgemental panic rather choke than be a hypocrite<br>
Shoved back to square one<br>
Lonesome on the internet<br>
Go to sleep at four<br>
Open up your eyes at noon<br>
Appetites in hiding<br>
Feel like dying from a bite of food<br>
Mind likes to liken you to heinous<br>
Wicked people<br>
Only visible part of the world is ways the shit is evil<br>
Fighting with your dad<br>
Fighting with yourself more<br>
You not helping shit when self pity overwhelms your ability to think or act<br>
You gon’ let it kick your ass<br>
And everyone is worse off so I guess it’s tit for tat<br>
<br>
[Hook]<br>
Is it nicer down the road?<br>
Is it brighter as we go?<br>
Is it nicer down the road?<br>
Is it brighter as we go?<br></p>
