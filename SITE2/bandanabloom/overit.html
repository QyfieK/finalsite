						<h2>Get Over It</h2>
						<p>
[Hook: REY GWEN]<br>
I don’t think I could just get over it, over it<br>
You see me bite my tongue and make a joke of it, joke of it<br>
I don’t think I could just get over it, over it<br>
You see me bite my tongue and make a joke of it, joke of it<br>
<br>
[Verse 1: bandanabloom]<br>
See that seven colon one five and I’m upright<br>
Kick the door open both shoelaces untied<br>
Coasting off of luck ‘til that well runs dry<br>
But probably sticking to my guns whenever help comes by<br>
Memories eventually all gon’ end up in the furnace<br>
Shaking fist might reach the sky alongside a shout of curses<br>
Camera zoom in on my face I’m asking Who can say for sure this life was meant for me<br>
Birds fly by the sun sets over the empty street<br>
Confidence level look like y equals sinx<br>
Light nowhere in sight man I might
Need an eye check<br>
Digest feelings locked inside piss poorly<br>
Sidewalk lookin like the plank<br>
Up like nine, ten stories<br>
One cannonball away grom the boneyard<br>
Navigating just with instincts and the North Star<br>
Happy ending so far fetched in my stone-hard head<br>
Hiding from the scary monsters in the Rorschach test<br>



[Hook: REY GWEN]<br>
I don’t think I could just get over it, over it<br>
You see me bite my tongue and make a joke of it, joke of it<br>
I don’t think I could just get over it, over it<br>
You see me bite my tongue and make a joke of it, joke of it<br>
<br>
[Verse 2: bandanabloom]<br>
Everyone’s got their own things<br>
Past wounds you know sting now<br>
Fitting in the shoes of someone that you won’t bring down<br>
But when duty calls its possible that phone rings out<br>
Cold wind blow through the window<br>
The bros cracking jokes that are stones throw from insult<br>
Neurons gon explode like coke and a mento<br>
Holes in my mental<br>
Frozen in place no-show at the signal<br>
If shit goes south I’m hoping this chin won’t<br>
Folders of notes chokehold on the pencil<br>
Wait ‘til that money come in droves I’ma lay it out in rows like I’m going for bingo<br>
Shrugging off the hopelessness my soul encoded with<br>
Rolling that fucking boulder stead of posing as a bowling pin<br>
Better days approaching but the process is slow as shit<br>
The only place I really need to be is up and over it but<br>
<br>
[Hook: REY GWEN]<br>
I don’t think I could just get over it, over it<br>
You see me bite my tongue and make a joke of it, joke of it<br>
I don’t think I could just get over it, over it<br>
You see me bite my tongue and make a joke of it, joke of it<br></p>
