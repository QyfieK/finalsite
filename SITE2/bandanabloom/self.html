						<h2>Self Care</h2>
						<p>
[Verse 1]<br>
What you do when you’re in hell on every sunny morning<br>
Cause boy It’s a tough world I hope you got the stomach for it<br>
The skies gorgeous and you hard at work on something unimportant<br>
Acting colder than a fucking bear mother’s porridge<br>
Dreams of picking posies from a flower bed<br>
Cronies up around the bend<br>
And when they ask for whereabouts<br>
I scramble out the house again<br>
Cleanse myself of sin by standing underneath the shower head<br>
Or try and try and blow it like a powder keg<br>
Stumble ‘round town past thе inner and the outer еnds<br>
Innards spilling every passing second to my friends<br>
Panic-stricken as it gets<br>
Steady mixin right and left up<br>
And I’m gon beat myself up til I’m up on a stretcher<br>
Vision getting foggy how I’m under the weather<br>
Man I’m going MIA send out my love in some letters and get up off of the grid<br>
Reset the progress to nada and start pickin the options I’m fucking confident in<br>
<br>

[Hook]<br>
You tried for self care it didn’t go as intended<br>
You ready to leave and you you don’t have a minute<br>
To spare<br>
You worry bout it all of the time<br>
And you make it okay with a song and a rhyme<br>
<br>
[Verse 2]<br>
(Oh my god, fuck you)<br>
Yea, And you make it right when you hum a tune<br>
Counting sheep tucked in and give it up after one or two (Thank you so much)<br>
Spending class in comas you looking dumb when you coming to<br>
Body unconscious next to the Hoops you should be jumping through (You tried for self care, sorry I’m tired, I’m sorry)<br>
Ima give it all when you ask it<br>
But I’m exhausted so often I phone it in otherwise<br>
Like maybe I’ll make this bed<br>
My thinking wishful tonight<br>
And If recklessness doesn’t kill me I picture misery might<br>
Aye, Ask how the fuck to relax when you’re given minutes to try<br>
Stability’s out the question you trip and flip on your side<br>
Mind racing images flicker still biting my tongue<br>
That’s after I pick up all of the wisdom and soothing drinks I can find<br>
Keeping cool out of fear and my fucking wits out of spite<br>
And everything going wrongs as if I’m equipped for surprise<br>
Stitch in my side nothing Im wandering round dizzy<br>
I pray that a trucks coming I’m taking it down with me<br>
<br>

[Hook]<br>

<br>
[Outro: bandanabloom & mason infinity]<br>
Was that recorded? Yeah, dude<br>
Holy shit<br>
Dude it’s like-<br>
That was probably the most bizarre interaction I've ever had<br>
He was like sorry I’m so tired<br>
I just fucking dropped your card<br></p>
