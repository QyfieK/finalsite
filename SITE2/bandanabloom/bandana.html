						<h2>BANDANA</h2>
						<p>
Can't save the world when I need to get to class first<br>
All my old friends got it backwards<br>
Livin' in pretend, I'm an actor<br>
The artist at work<br>
It's how I'm walkin' off from marginal hurt<br>
Need to tell me again, shit's a disaster<br>
Preaching to the choir like a pastor<br>
Improbable it all could be worse<br>
I'm always rootin' for you<br>
Often moving bark through the dirt<br>
I stitch your heart into the arm of my shirt<br>
Shit's not fair like Falcon and Knees<br>
Tidal Wave, goodbye<br>
I'm out with the breeze<br>
Months of absence keep my salary cheap<br>
Nothing's hard when you're all wrinkled<br>
This art's got my heart sinkin'<br>
Like a bad guesser's Battleship Fleet<br>
Lookin' lifeless as a corpse everyday
Like I'm stabbed in the abdomen<br>
Was never one for yappin' through
Chapped mask padded lips<br>
Bad bastard kid until I blossom like a flower<br>
Boy, my head is straight (Ironic)<br>
Thoughts that cross it in the shower<br>
Lookin' both ways 'fore I flush 'em down the fuckin' drain pipe<br>
Beats get railed like the tail end of date night<br>
Like they're holding trains tight<br>
I make 'em to destroy 'em<br>
So I feel like Victor Frankenstein, I'm takin' a hike<br>
Hardly stumblin', old Cons crunchin' the dry leaves<br>
Unzipped jacket, Sunkissed as Khai Dreams<br>
Don't need much, tough skin to find peace<br>
Handle business easy as a monkey fuckin' climbs trees<br>
Head tucked into my knees<br>
Now I'm headed out, full tux with the tight sleeves<br>
New Forces, they're shined clean<br>
In the night, find my little light<br>
Shine a bit brighter than attire of radium jaw victims<br>
More drive than treats inside of behaving good dogs' systems<br>
Silent, siphon checks like Verizon<br>
I'm feelin' something like Midas when I'm touching up<br>
The bass and they all listen<br>
Three years, in and out of practice<br>
In my room, goin' mad as hatters<br>
Head's noddin', it's black magic<br>
I'm not here for you<br>
Seventeen, and my mind's stupid<br>
The sound matches on lighter fluid<br>
State facts and you cry, "Delusion!"<br>
I'm not here for you<br>
Lately, I've been both stuck and free<br>
Constructing duct tape fucks to row out this sea<br>
But my paddle had it tethered to where I'm supposed to be<br>
And now the weather just steered me so pretentiously, uh<br>
On the count of three<br>
Try to feel something that wasn't based on conceit<br>
I can't see<br>
Parietal's guidin' me, cause now I'm blinded by the lights<br>
And my weekends are one-night sprees<br>
Lost the map, how am I gonna get back?<br>
Nevermind, piggyback a collab track<br>
Glued to my ego but unfettered flow fast<br>
Too slow, I'm in Schrodinger's Trap<br>
I'll try to end on a high<br>
I'll try to fly to the sky<br>
I'll try to tell all the lies<br>
But I'm not Icarus<br>
Going way too far, I'm way sick of this<br>
I don't even drive a car, I'm too insolent<br>
I'll try to go too far, I'll try to go too far<br>
I'll try to go too far<br>
I'll try to go too far, I'll try to go too far<br>
I'll try to go too far (yeah, I'll try to go too far)<br>
Never had to go alone<br>
I don't ever think we'll ever roam past our<br>
Overthrown plastic thrones<br>
We're just always, always in our zone<br>
Never had to go alone<br>
I don't ever think we'll ever roam past our<br>
Overthrown plastic thrones<br>
We're just always, always in our zone<br>
Never had to go alone<br>
I don't ever think we'll ever roam past our<br>
Overthrown plastic thrones<br>
We're just always, always in our zone<br>
Three years, in and out of practice<br>
In my room, goin' mad as hatters<br>
Head's noddin', it's black magic<br>
I'm not here for you<br>
Seventeen, and my mind's stupid<br>
The sound matches on lighter fluid<br>
State facts and you cry, "Delusion!"<br>
I'm not here for you<br>
Three years, in and out of practice (Never had to go alone)<br>
In my room, goin' mad as hatters (I don't ever think we'll roam)<br>
Head's noddin', it's black magic (Past our overthrown plastic thrones)<br>
I'm not here for you (We're just always, always in our zone)<br>

I'm not here for you?<br></p>
