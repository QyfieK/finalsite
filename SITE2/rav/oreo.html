						<h2>Apophis Oreos</h2>
						<p>
[Intro]<br>
EXO, EXO, Let's see, Let's go<br>
A-A-A-A-Alchemist<br>
(R-A-V)<br>

[Verse]<br>
I'm in the alley chewing on Oreos<br>
R-AV come through like glory holes<br>
I be that wizard on the forty ounce audio<br>
Infectious genital wart-y flow<br>
Uh, yo, with a switchblade I'm ugly (yea, yea, yea)<br>
Y'all bitch-made like puppies (yea, yea, yea)<br>
Your rich gang can suck these nuts<br>
Bitch, I be insane like Chucky<br>
For better or worse, I will never endorse<br>
No competitors, editors and et cetera in this era of area<br>
Your opinions don't matter (nah)<br>
Queue pursuits and stick it out I figured out the synonym pattern<br>
And I'm just laughing (ha)<br>
Rav is type awesome (ha)<br>
Cut-cut vein, young Mike Larson (uh huh)<br>
Step to sun and you just might blossom<br>
Yo, I make a rapper fall<br>
I inspire autumn<br>
Yes, like this! How you like this? (uh)<br>
Fuck if I care about your likeness<br>
I won't treat you like your highness<br>
You're so feeble, you're a minus<br>
You will bleed into your sinus when I slide that rusty blade right through your teeth and see you smiling<br>
<br>

Apophis been returned, ho<br>
It's me on the papyrus (uh)<br>
Peeking through the iris (uh)<br>
Lead a band of pirates (uh)<br>
Reefer in the stylus (uh)<br>
Chief up, I'm the pilot<br>
The world's a freak asylum and I need to seek asylum (ok)<br>
I'm like "Quiet, on that loud. Why my speaking seem so silent?"<br>
Seeking out a sound<br>
While your speech seems like a siren (siren)<br>
Catch you in these streets where I'll see you suiciding<br>
And I'll see my soul excited when I see your soul expiring (yeah)<br>
Seems there's no deciding if the scene is slowly dying<br>
Sleeping all the times is the most simple of all science (science)<br>
E-X-O, now that's a symbol of defiance<br>
Saying you simpletons deciphering my symbol in society<br>
Perceive me as a sidekick (what)<br>
It simply cease that side cred (what)<br>
Come see me in the cyber<br>
Sipping life were seeping from your eyelids<br>
Never cease to see it even when I'm seated on the side<br>
Right-hand side sick and tired of these here liars<br>
<br>
Eating Caesar salad while you slip n' sliding shakes so break and Pile it up like six of your assignments<br>
A scientist decides it's time she came into see me psych psych<br>
I'm speaking Tarius to see you bitter, geeks are crying<br>
Stripe your indecisive psyche, ope it's Mr. Simon<br>
I'm sick of cell six sail them with the sickle priceless<br>
Seizing Lima sorta like a heap of diamonds, Jesus Christ<br>
Is with the nicest, you ain't seen proceed to spite him<br>
But your skills won't suffice for me to even size you up<br>
But it's decent to a genius who can clearly see inside you<br>
I insist you decease, please cease the cycle<br>
Seamlessly i seem insightful, eat this apple, sweet disciple<br>
<br>
