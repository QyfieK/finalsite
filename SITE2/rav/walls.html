[Intro]<br>
Na-na-na-na-na-na-na<br>
Na-na-na-na-na-na-na<br>
Sitting in my room, what am I doing?<br>
Nothing<br>
Staring out the window of my tomb, the roof crumbling<br>
My mood dumping thoughts of true tedium, and doom and abundance, wrapped in the depression that I seem to be truly in love with<br>
<br>
[Verse 1]<br>
Look, I wanna visit Charleston again<br>
Puff a thousand more blunts, while spittin' bars with my friends. But a ticket costs a lot<br>
Cost of living, costs a lot more<br>
Which is stronger: my indifference, or persistence? Not sure<br>
Rock forth, chair squeaks, all I hear is reverb<br>
I can sense the room telling me this is what I deserve<br>
All out of kush so I can't leave Earth<br>
Stuck with visiting my memories and goals<br>
Like, could it be worse?<br>

<br>
[Hook]<br>
I'm just chilling, doin' nothing on the balcony<br>
Pondering what the fuck will I amount to be<br>
<br>
[Verse 2]<br>
Probably nothing man, according to these YouTube comments<br>
Look I love honesty<br>
But shit, sometimes you dudes too honest!<br>
My music voodoo harmless chill, just let me do my shit<br>
I need to run, my tongue still ain't accomplished shit<br>
I move still but you dudes kill my mood<br>
Like, way too fucking much so homie I'm good<br>
No more social networking for another few months<br>
Roll up a few blunts but nothing too much<br>
<br>
[Chorus]<br>
And that's right, that's right we back again<br>
Float into the booth ready to rap again<br>
But I hate every take of every song<br>
Perhaps all them haters on that one thread weren't wrong<br>
<br>
[Verse 3]<br>
What am I doing?<br>
Sitting in my room consuming, feeling fluent<br>
And saying nothing all day long<br>
No matter what I do feels like I'm always wrong<br>
My cerebral hallways long<br>
Life is a game, I'd rather go play pong<br>
The world's a stage, I'd rather roleplay on another planet<br>
Bumpin' Aesop all day long<br>

<br>
[Chorus]<br>
And that's right, here comes another day<br>
'Bout to bore myself to death another way<br>
I kinda wanna stop and fucking run away<br>
But none of me has energy<br>
What the fuck has got into me?<br>
<br>
[Verse 4]<br>
What am I doing with myself?<br>
I have influenced my own health<br>
Stopped pursuing what I felt<br>
And thus keep losing out on the future I can feel<br>
Sure, I can't fail<br>
But who cares, right?<br>
With food, chair and a mic<br>
I can't bear life<br>
And I'm too scared to lose hair<br>
And my blue hair tonight<br>
Blue chair with a gloom stare<br>
Am I too petrified?<br>
Do you care?<br>
Does who care?<br>
Um, who stares inside<br>
Blue hair in sight<br>
My blue fears in sight<br>
That's too true<br>
That's three true<br>
The truth is on five<br>
Lose sleep till fright<br>
Fuck that<br>
Imma have to do some shit<br>
Gain shit, man, once I lose some shit<br>
So Imma fucking lose my shit<br>
Throwing out the stupid pair of shoes that used to truly fit<br>
Y'all be downloading all of my shit 'cause truly dude legit<br>
Or the crew that truly spits<br>
Cross my crew? Get crucifixed<br>
Or crucified<br>
Hear them pull the loser lied<br>
What's downloading dude supplies, thus admitting dude is nice<br>
Shit, take dude advice<br>
Don't fuck with EXO, we've been fuck your ex hoes<br>
What are you doing?<br></p>
