						<h2>THE RETURN</h2>
						<p>
[Sample: The Preacher by Brock Berrigan]<br>
Brock, could you say a few words?<br>
Okay, but just as few as I possibly can<br>
<br>
[Verse 1: Rav]<br>
The return of the one brought<br>
Under?<br>
The ground with the thunder<br>
Hunger?<br>
Run as I conquer, one love<br>
Shut the fuck up bitch, gun draw, run the<br>
E to the X-O<br>
Baggin' beats in the whip<br>
Keep a motherfuckin' piece in the barrel<br>
Enemy is nothing special<br>
Keep the dental piece in the freezer for being disrespectful<br>
Dammit I'm still a fucking beast!<br>
There ain't no reason could subdue<br>
With the beauty cull the beast<br>
<br>

[Sample: The Preacher by Brock Berrigan]<br>
I can't keep up! I can't-<br>
<br>
[Verse 2: Rav]<br>
Cruising through the city<br>
Throwing doobies at police<br>
'Cause you see, truly I love trees<br>
So I consume them when I please to<br>
Keep pursuing music<br>
Losing plenty of that sleep<br>
So I never fail to dodge the cupid shooting at my cheeks<br>
Doing stupid but unique shit<br>
No way in hell am I losing too much sleeps<br>
Boy know well<br>
I excel in this sorta rhymin'<br>
If you've got a problem<br>
It ain't hard to find me<br>
Yeah I'm back up in this bitch and I'm flyer than an airport<br>
I ain't bringing shit back, I'm putting myself forth<br>
Well-worn Timberlands scratching the cartel's floor<br>
Said I was gone and y'all fell for it<br>
Motherfucker I'm back<br>
Mr. R-AV<br>
Going hard on the app<br>
Putting bars on the track<br>
You react<br>
I'm Rav<br>
Apophis has returned<br>
The EXO lined up, showed the prophecy's confirmed<br>
Sucka MCs most probably concerned<br>
As you will see motherfuckers never learn<br>
Still choking on them trees<br>
Though I never stopped to burn<br>
Kush puts me at ease and puts me to sleep<br>
I do what I want man<br>
Apop said<br>
"Gah! Did y'all miss me?"<br>
Whoop!<br>
It's R-A-V!<br>
<br>
[Sample: The Preacher by Brock Berrigan]<br>
I can't keep up! I can't! It's not possible!<br>
We don't know where it came from, we can't imagine where it goes<br></p>
