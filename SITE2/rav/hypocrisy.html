						<p>
[Intro]
<br>(It's eassssy)
<br>First she tells me to chill
<br>Then she pass me the bong
<br>And she's sittin' right by me
<br>Singing my song
<br>She tells me to smile
<br>And hit this 'til you're gone
<br>And she's sittin' right by me
<br>And she's singin' my song
<br>Singing my song
<br>She keeps singing my song

<br>

<br>[Verse]
<br>She tells me that it's worth it
<br>Life
<br>That it's perfect
<br>You're right
<br>How adorable, and horribly naive
<br>And nice
<br>But these stories of her dormancy are boring me
<br>She's telling me that quarantine of feelings isn't normal
<br>See, I'm like, "Okay girl, yeah okay girl right"
<br>Individual perceptions make this world right (what?)
<br>You're telling me not to care
<br>And yet here you are
<br>Caring 'bout me caring yet again, huh? (huh?)
<br>Every time I tell you that my life sucks (my life sucks)
<br>You try convincing me that my life ain't as bad as yours (what?)
<br>So I say -uh- okay, well your life sucks? (your life sucks)
<br>But then, why can't mine as well? As we laugh, word
<br>Hah, Yeah
<br>You're cuter than a bunny (Uh)
<br>And no I ain't thirsty but this buddha got me hungry (Uh, Uh)
<br>Yeah
<br>It soothes and it numbs me (Yeah)
<br>You're telling me to quit yet your the one that's puffin (Ha)
<br>
<br>[Hook]
<br>Tells me to chill
<br>Then she pass me the bong
<br>Then she's sittin' right by me
<br>Singing my song
<br>She tells me to smile
<br>And hit this till you gone
<br>And she's sittin' right by me
<br>And she's singin' my song
<br>Singing my song
<br>She keeps singing my song
<br>Singing my song
<br>She keeps singing my song
<br>First she tells me to chill
<br>Then she pass me the bong
<br>Then she's sittin' right by me
<br>Singing my song
<br>Yeah
<br>

<br>[Outro]
<br>Just close your eyes
<br>Just close your eyes
<br>Just close your eyes
<br>And fly with me tonight
<br>Just close your eyes (we ain't gotta hear about nobody else)
<br>Just close your eyes (we ain't gotta hear about nobody else)
<br>Just close your eyes (we ain't gotta hear about nobody else)
<br>(We ain't gotta hear about nobody else)
