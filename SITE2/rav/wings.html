[Intro]<br>
Reaching for the stars, singing different songs, hitting different bongs<br>
Tell myself I'll have anything I want<br>
As you listen on questioning our bond, but don't get me wrong<br>
Steal your heart I will, but clip your wings I won't<br>
Drifting on<br>
Clip your wings I won't won't won't won't<br>
Clip your wings I won't won't won't won't<br>
Clip your wings I won't, clip your wings I won't<br>
Clip your wings I won't, clip your wings I won't<br>
Clip your wings I won't, clip your -<br>
<br>

[Hook]<br>
Reaching for the stars, singing different songs, hitting different bongs<br>
Tell myself I'll have anything I want<br>
As you listen, on questioning our bond, but don't get me wrong<br>
Steal your heart I will, but, clip your wings I won't<br>
Drifting on<br>
<br>
[Verse]<br>
Never needed help<br>
Tearing up my pleasures, I keep wearing out my health<br>
Telling me I keep terrifying everybody else<br>
Matter of fact, you’re surprised I ain’t scared of myself, ha<br>
Well, whatever<br>
No I ain't claiming I ain't never made an error<br>
When I felt worse, I remember feeling better<br>
Feeling better never failed to recollect my former terror<br>
Moving like a tachyon disregarding rules<br>
Picking up and dropping anything that ain't of use<br>
Feeling temperamental, but you're getting me confused<br>
You ain't gotta compromise, once together, we can't lose<br>
Truth is, I'm fucked up and barely pure but don't feel insecure<br>
You are an angel, remain one forever<br>
You're special to me and yourself, don't forget this too<br>
Don't clip your wings for a devil so terrible<br>
<br>
[Hook]<br>
Reaching for the stars, singing different songs, hitting different bongs<br>
Tell myself I'll have anything I want<br>
As you listen on, questioning our bond, but don't get me wrong<br>
Steal your heart I will, but clip your wings I won't<br>
Drifting on<br>
<br>
[Outro]<br>
Clip your wings I won't won't won't won't<br>
Na na na na na na<br>
Clip your wings I won't won't won't won't<br>
Na na na na na na<br></p>
