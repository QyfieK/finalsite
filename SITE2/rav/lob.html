						<h2>LOBECTOMY</h2>
						<p>
[Verse 1]<br>
See, I'm a feminist<br>
But I hate you, whore<br>
I'd applaud if you could make me hate you more<br>
Tried to dodge a couple battles<br>
Couldn't escape the war<br>
Now you blogging on the net<br>
"Why you hate me for?"<br>
You thought I wore my heart on my sleeve<br>
But honestly, boo, I keep it where it belongs, huh<br>
As far away from you<br>
Your claims that you're special are horribly untrue<br>
See your type is common, momma<br>
There's a lot of fucking tools, and<br>
<br>

[Hook]<br>
Bitch<br>
I don't like you, cunt<br>
Tried to cut me, hoe<br>
But your knife was blunt<br>
Don't know why every time that I am in love<br>
They'll think that I need them more than I need lungs<br>
And so it's<br>
LOBECTOMY<br>
(Bitch)<br>
(Your time has come)<br>
LOBECTOMY<br>
(Your time has come)<br>
LOBECTOMY<br>
(Your time has come)<br>
LOVE AIN'T FOR ME<br>
(Your time has come)<br>
<br>
[Verse 2]<br>
It's whatever, hoe, it's no longer affecting me<br>
You still throwing shit with horrible trajectory<br>
Okay, cut you off like lobectomy<br>
Keep doing it until there's nothing left of me<br>
Whenever these sluts size me up<br>
Talk shit or lie 'bout having spiked their cups<br>
I'll throw fuel to the fire, and would I give fucks?<br>
Nope, I'd laugh and just use the fire to light my blunt, 'cause<br>
<br>
[Hook]<br>
Bitch<br>
I don't like you, cunt<br>
Tried to cut me, hoe<br>
But your knife was blunt<br>
Don't know why everytime that I am in love<br>
They'll think that I need them more than I need lungs<br>
And so it's<br>
LOBECTOMY<br>
(Bitch)<br>
(Your time has come)<br>
LOBECTOMY<br>
(Your time has come)<br>
LOBECTOMY<br>
(Your time has come)<br>
LOVE AIN'T FOR ME<br>
(Your time has come)<br>
<br>
[Verse 3]<br>
Go, go, go hate me<br>
Hoe, hoe, hoe, baby<br>
It's so crazy that you're so sad now<br>
And all I wish to see's your name on a toetag now<br>
AND I DON'T NEED TO PUT ALL OF THE REASONS IN THIS SONG<br>
I JUST WANT THE WORLD TO KNOW<br>
I HATE YOU, YOU'RE A BROAD<br>
I HOPE THAT THIS BREAKS YOU<br>
AND HELPS ME TO SHAKE YOU OFF<br>
FUNNY HOW YOU MADE ME HARD<br>
WHILE I JUST MADE YOU SOFT<br>
BITCH<br>
YOUR TIME HAS COME<br>
YOUR TIME HAS COME<br>
YOUR TIME HAS COME<br>
Yeah, your time has come<br></p>
