[Intro]<br>
Good evening, ladies and gentlemen<br>
Uh, this is, uh, Hip Hop Minute with Rav<br>
I'll be your host for the evening
Sp, without a further ado, let's get some bars going, shall we?
One take, let's go<br>
<br>
[Verse 1]<br>
I've been to hell and back, and now I'm back in hell again
"Hip Hop is trash," "no it's not", "it's wack," "it's never been"<br>
How traditional you are is practically irrelevant<br>
So, put your brow down before I slap you out your element<br>
Motherfucker bow down when I can clown clown artists<br>
Bow wow, all bark, never sound parlous<br>
Harmless, stupid unprofessionals<br>
I just do me like a music solosexual<br>
True shit, I do this 'til I'm useless or a vegetable<br>
You claim rap's your bitch?<br>
Abusive and essentially musically unethical<br>
You foolish hoe ass<br>
Say you spit that cool ish, but your cool ish all ass<br>
Fame and fortune, y'all pursuing all that<br>
But lying to everyone like "I do this for the craft, I do this for myself"<br>
Why you put it out, then?<br>
Keep it to yourself, bitch, or stop talking 'bout it, yeah
<br>
<br>
[Interlude]<br>
No, I mean it, like so many people just keep fucking saying the same thing over and over again<br>
Just keep it on your PC<br>
You like that my voice cracked there?<br>
Anyway, next verse is dedicated to someone<br>
Guess who<br>
<br>
[Verse 2]<br>
Charles Hamilton can suck my nuts, I ain't mad at him<br>
But for talking trash I'mma smack you when I have a chance<br>
Stupid fucking pseudo-intellectual, how dare you?<br>
I approached you as a fan, now won't get anywhere near you<br>
A year back or two I got an invite from your manager to tour with you that summer<br>
But in life, Charles, you're an amateur, so I turned it down<br>
The both of y'all, remember?<br>
But I still helped the both of y'all? (Remember?)<br>
And both of y'all dumb as fuck with big fucking budgets<br>
And still fucking up, like what the fuck? How the fuck, kid?<br>
I was about 16 when I heard of you<br>
Now I'm 21 that's the age at which I've murdered you<br>
And you deserve it dude<br>
That plus servitude<br>
<br>
I only said that 'cause it rhymed<br>
<br>
[Outro]<br>
Yo, I'm just fucking with you, Charles, whatever man<br>
No grudges, good luck!<br>
Keep the positive energy going<br>
I mean positive for myself, I don't give a fuck how you're feeling<br>
Any one of you, actually<br>
Did you enjoy that? (Yeah) I'm sure you did<br>
Peace to Kill Bill, peace to drythought, suddlenuance, peace to Scuare<br>
(Gibberish)<br>
Yo, what the fuck was that?<br></p>
