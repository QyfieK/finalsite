[Intro: Rav]<br>
(R-A-V, Uh!)<br>
<br>
[Verse 1: Rav]<br>
I'm spitting, suckers coughing open up in the brackets<br>
Wack motherfuckers once hoping that I left<br>
I formed EXO, got involved and I evolved myself<br>
"Only 5 motherfuckers?" Yea we dope as hell, huh?<br>
A bunch of broken selves made out of broken cells, smoke 'em well<br>
Homie you don't like us? You can smoke yourselves<br>
Focus, the person to your right makes bogus claims always<br>
The person to your left has hopelessly slow wit<br>
And your parents are both twits<br>
Apparently, this planet's programming is broke, man, and it won't fix<br>
So abandon all your plans and your hopes, kids<br>
And take a chance in expanding your dumb ol' selves<br>
But hey, this city's got your life, don't it?<br>
You don't need the key to the city to break the lock open<br>
So stop coping, start living and stop choking<br>
Start screaming 'till your fucking voicebox broken<br>
I'm not joking, do what you need to do<br>
They might never grant you to the key to the city, dude<br>
But to claim to be 'prisoned by the system isn't true<br>
'Cause, in the end, you're the only one that holds the key to you<br>
And the dream of a life is what you've been sleeping through<br>
You could always seize the day, or simply proceed to drool<br>
You might ask "Why take advice from a young conceited fool?"<br>
I might answer, you don't have to, after all, I'm just a rapper<br>

<br>
[Pre-Chorus]<br>
You spend your time within these tall walls<br>
You claim that they're trapping you inside<br>
But you're scared to climb up out of these walls<br>
And it's crazy that you've never even tried<br>
<br>
[Chorus: Rav & Kill Bill: The Rapper]<br>
"Sociesuicide"<br>
Don't believe in the rumors, you hold the very key to your future<br>
"Sociesuicide"<br>
And no reason is stupid<br>
Movement, the leaf to the nudist<br>
"Sociesuicide"<br></p>
