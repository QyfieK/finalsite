						<h2>This was a demo for this one song but I couldn't find the more up to date version so this'll have to do, sorry</h2>
						<p>[Verse 1]<br>
Rav gon' kill it<br>
Assholes finish<br>
With the help of your hubris<br>
Display ragdoll physics<br>
Back in this bitch don't act all physical<br>
Look I don't call cats, I don't cat call bitches<br>
<br><br>
[Refrain]<br>
Yeah‚ any doodle I rock<br>
With that zip-zap-zoob-zob-zoobity-whop<br>

<br><br>
[Verse 2]<br>
Yeah cleaner and balder than Mr. Clean<br>
Folds fold and I clothes them the history<br>
And it still is a mystery<br>
How EXO stay so cold when I change my flow<br>
Judge me and hate try to figure me out<br>
But I'll never bow down to no bigoted clown<br>
<br><br>
[Pre-Chorus]<br>
Yeah<br>
What's good y'all?<br>
Back up in this (bitch homie)<br>
Guess‚ who's‚ back? (EXO!)<br>
Huh, come on and<br>
<br>
[Chorus]<br>
Fuck with me<br>
Fuck with me<br>
Fuck with me<br>
Fuck with me<br>
Fuck with me<br>
Fuck with me<br>
<br><br>
[Verse 3]<br>
Step into my shoes but mind the blood that's within them<br>
No butt fucks ever given<br>
Ya ho will talk never listen<br>
Crawled up out the populous prison<br>
This sparked innocuous vision<br>
I got no car but bitch I walk like I'm driven<br>
Underground back greedy industries expose<br>
Watch every major label turn E-M-O (Okay)<br>
<br><br>

[Verse 4]<br>
Out with the gimmicks and in with the E-X-O<br>
Yae got game like PS4<br>
Back up in this bitch never see us go<br>
Doper than before Rav CS:GO<br>
Illest rapper spittin' since they've seen Esco<br>
Yeah man fuck all that shit, for perceive his goal<br>
<br><br>
It's clear all I see is smoke<br>
Step into my shoes and your feet get cold<br>
Little dig in the industry‚ fickle sicken me most<br>
The frequent flippant fucking sickly tickles me I suppose<br>
<br><br>
[Fucks]<br>
Gon' fuck fuck fuck with me<br>
Yo fuck fuck fuck with me<br>
Yeah fuck fuck fuck with me<br>
Said fuck fuck fuck with me<br>
Yeah (fuck fuck fuck with me)<br>
Fuck with me<br>
(Fuck Fuck Fuck with me)<br>
Fuck with me<br>
(Fuck Fuck Fuck with me)<br>
Fuck with me<br>
(Fuck Fuck Fuck with me)<br>
Yeah, uh<br>
<br><br>
Fuck fuck fuck with me<br>
And we keep goin'<br>
Fuck fuck fuck with me<br>
And we keep goin'<br>
Fuck fuck fuck with me<br>
And we keep goin'<br>
Fuck fuck fuck with me<br>
And we keep goin'<br>
Fuck fuck fuck with me<br>
And we keep goin'<br>
Fuck fuck fuck with me<br>
And we keep goin'<br>
Fuck fuck fuck with me<br>
And we keep goin'<br>
Fuck fuck fuck with me<br>
And we keep goin'<br>
Fuck fuck fuck with me<br>
And we keep goin'<br>
Fuck fuck fuck with me<br>
And we keep goin'<br>
Fuck fuck fuck with me<br>
And we keep goin'<br>
Fuck fuck fuck with me<br>
And we keep goin'<br>
<br><br>
[Pre-Chorus]<br>
Hah<br>
Man I missed this<br>
Yo<br>
Come on and<br>
<br>
[Chorus]<br>
Fuck with me<br>
Fuck with me<br>
Fuck with me<br>
Fuck with me<br>
Fuck with me<br>
Fuck with me<br>
<br><br>
[Outro]<br>
(One time, y'all)<br>
I don't how to dance<br>
I don't follow no common sense<br>
I've grown hollow but confidence<br>
Ought to to dodge my incompetence<br>
Auto-piloting operate sparking constantly bothering<br>
Nobody‚ I'm outta here<br>
Nose diving in ponds of tears<br></p>
