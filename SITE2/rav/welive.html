[Intro: Scuare]<br>
Give your pain to me<br>
Give your pain to me<br>
And everything will be<br>
Everything will be<br>
Alright in the morning when the rain starts pouring and it's plain to see<br>
Give your pain to me<br>
Give your pain to me<br>
And everything will be<br>
Everything will be<br>
Alright in the morning when the rain starts pouring and it's plain to see<br>
(That we're all alone)<br>
Give your pain to me<br>
(That we're all alone) give your pain to me<br>
And everything will be<br>
(That we're all alone) and everything will be<br>
Alright in the morning when the rain starts pouring and it's plain to see<br>
<br>

[Verse 1: Scuare]<br>
All of us are calculated reflections of a wannabe
To buy into a lie and try to deny it like it wasn't free
Inconclusive arguments defining what the limit is
Whining 'bout the cynics 'stead of finding what a sinner is
Pining over timing with a theory's relativity
Eloquent recitals of an ethic, no one's listening<br>
Ideas on the wall, running circles like they second hand<br>
The peace bring rest, so we praying with our weapon hand<br>
Two teams and they playin' like it's Tekken<br>
No one's keeping score up in heaven, Mr. Reverend<br>
So why you pressing? 'Getcha hands up off my neck<br>
Rich fucks breathing lies and saying I ain't got respect<br>
Tiny fractions of your earnings, give it back to the community<br>
And we just keep on feeding it to buy ourselves some unity<br>
It's all fun and games till your fate is intertwined<br>
With a bullet through your brain cause of a goddamned sign<br>
<br>
[Hook: Scuare]<br>
Every sin, paper thin, pull the pin, watch it pop<br>
Every dream, everything dies when the brain stops, dies<br>
When the brain stops, dies when the brain stops<br>
Every dream, everything dies when the brain stops<br>
Every sin, paper thin, pull the pin, watch it pop<br>
Every dream, everything dies when the brain stops, dies<br>
When the brain stops, dies when the brain stops<br>
Every sin ever been dies when the brain's lost<br>
<br>
[Verse 2: Rav]<br>
Ask for forgiveness or else you'll go to hell<br>
We're all born as sinners with selfishness in self<br>
Regret is not enough<br>
Better run to the confessional<br>
Just say you're sorry once<br>
And the lord will never question you<br>
And ignore all the knowledge that we've gained throughout the centuries<br>
Most of us won't accept that questions get answered eventually<br>
When your child has leukaemia, ignore your doctor's words<br>
Just take your child to church<br>
Cause holy water works!<br>
And when your daughter dies, don't fret<br>
See, "God is testing you"<br>
Repent and persevere, then Jesus Christ will rescue you<br>
Follow the book, don't trust your own perceptions, dude<br>
Cause we're easily gullible, instructions were hence sent to you<br>
And don't do good just cause you wanna be a good person<br>
Do it cause you wanna go to heaven<br>
See? Now that's worth it<br>
Do it cause you're scared of hell<br>
See? That works, shit!<br>
Miss out on life in the case that there's something after Earth, kid<br>
<br>
[Hook]<br>

[Bridge: Scuare, Rav] x3<br>
Give your pain to me<br>
Give your pain to me<br>
And everything will be<br>
Everything will be<br>
Alright in the morning when the rain starts pouring and it's plain to see<br>
Give your pain to me<br>
Give your pain to me<br>
And everything will be<br>
Everything will be<br>
Alright in the morning when the rain starts pouring and it's plain to see<br>
(That we're all alone)<br>
Give your pain to me<br>
(That we're all alone) give your pain to me<br>
And everything will be<br>
(That we're all alone) and everything will be<br>
Alright in the morning when the rain starts pouring and it's plain to see<br>
