						<h2>RICOCHET</h2>
						<p>
[Hook]<br>
It’s been a while since I’ve felt this way<br>
Let all the bad thoughts Ricochet<br>
It’s been a while since I’ve felt this way<br>
I’ve got a bunch of motherfucking things I gotta do<br>
Let all the bad thoughts Ricochet<br>
I’m, I’m, I’m<br>
<br>
[Verse 1]<br>
I’m feeling good, good, good wavy<br>
Feeling good lately<br>
Guess that kush scared me good<br>
Set out to build a better place, instead I built a rope<br>
Stressing out in search of bricks<br>
I came across a hefty load<br>
Shimmy shimmy yeah, shimmy yeah, shimmy yeah<br>
Give me the microphone so I can take it away<br>
Still a bunch of motherfuckers keep on sending me hate<br>
Still working, trying to get my curse with Benjamin straight<br>
I scrape<br>

<br>
The top of clouds, the ground seems artificial<br>
The cold caresses both my cheeks but never scars the tissue<br>
I’m guided by the stars that I’m a part of sentimental<br>
But not stupid ‘nough to get complacent<br>
Yeah sharpen my pencil<br>
Got credentials, of making mistakes, brushing them off<br>
Touching floor then standing straight and getting back to my jog, uh<br>
<br>
I built a house, burnt it down, built another one<br>
Then burned it down as well so fuck it I ain't fu-<br>
<br>
-ing good, good, good love<br>
I would climb the tallest mountain peak just for a hug<br>
I could hold the longest breath while swimming in her eyes<br>
Dancing with her heart, have it in her with her mind<br>
Her beauty source is infinite supplies<br>
Her smile could put a motherfucking serial killer in a bind<br>
Get a dealer high, or pink over eye<br>
Get you drunker than 57 pints of Miller Light<br>
<br>
I’m good, I’m feeling right<br>
See the past just left<br>
Yeah the past just left<br>
So going rad is only right<br>
I like to think of myself as seldom the corny type<br>
But sounding cheesy is expected when she on my mind and I'm surprised<br>
Where my heart used to be<br>
It's feeling something once again, yo, and truthfully<br>
<br>
Man I welcome it 'cause fuck it<br>
I've nothing here to lose<br>
Give me a glance into my mind<br>
It's straight and so it’s true and so it’s true<br>
<br>
[Hook]<br>
It’s been a while since I felt this way<br>
I’ve got a bunch of motherfucking things I gotta do<br>
Let all the bad thoughts Ricochet<br>
Not sure I’m sure just yet but sure as shit I’m not confused<br>
It’s been a while since I’ve felt this way<br>
Yo I’m in love<br>
Let all the bad thoughts Ricochet<br>
<br>
[Outro]<br>
I’m, I’m, I’m, I’m feeling good<br>
I’m feeling good<br></p>
