					<p>How Different Social Medias affect our mental health

By: Leon Bartosch Björk
SOCIAL MEDIA IS BAD! Now you don’t have to read the rest of this essay. But if you’ve read this far you probably have a higher attention span than most social media users. I’m only half joking.
Most texts concerning this topic use social media as a blanket term for everything online and that it all affects us the same. While there are similarities such as those stated by Jacquelyn Johnson in the article “What to know about social media and mental health?”[0], such as lack of sleep, it’s association with anxiety, depression and low self esteem. As well as the rise of suicide rates in teens between 2009 and 2017, the same time frame as the rise of the big social platforms. 
These articles often state cyberbullying and that it’s easier to insult someone with a screen between you. That implies that there’s still some sort of closeness between the bully and the victim, which in my experience just isn’t true nowadays. (I haven’t experienced it, just witnessed a few cases.)
In this essay I will cover mainly the cycle of herd mentality and parasocial relationships and how these play into the biggest social media platforms. 
General Background
In the article “What is Health? What Does Good Health Mean?” by Christian Nordqvist he mentions one of the requirements in WHOs list of what determines good health. That being a supporting community which social media can often provide, but more often than not these communities can harm more than help due to their toxicity. The first examplle that comes to mind is the fanbase surrounfing the cartoon show “Steven Universe” pushing a fan to suicide because they drew a character slightly out of proportion. That’s the angle of social media I want to touch on here. Large toxic groups.

Herd Mentality / Mob Mentality
Herd mentality is when the individual gives their own identity up to become part of a group which can push people to extremes. The definition of mob mentality is “a large and disorderly crowd of people, especially one bent on riotous or destructive action.” according to Marion Webster dictionary. In the article “Mob Mentality and Social Media”[1] the author states that mob mentality makes people act on an emotional level rather than a rational one. Gayook Wong states in the article “The Psychology of Mob Mentality”[3] what it does to the individual. Some of those being, loss of self awareness, loss of identity and heightened emotional responses such as anger. 
But how does this play into social media you may wonder? Well, it’s quite obvious. Two easy examples of online mob mentality are the BLM and MeToo movements, where it was used for good. In the early to mid 2010s women around the world were brave enough to out their abusers and take down some horrible people in power. They became part of a group and lost their identity to spread a good message. But as it grew, more and more people joined in. Some had never experienced any kind of abuse and were just swept up. So they fabricated claims about others to be part of the group and feel important.
This led to the modern cancel culture online where if some public figure has ever done anything slightly questionable ever in their life and it gets found out, thousands of people erupt in an explosion of hatred and death threats. This is at least my personal theory and is supported by Aja Romana in the article “The Second Wave of Cancel Culture”[7]. I’m not saying that we shouldn’t call public figures out when they do something wrong, but people need to think about if the thing they did was so bad that you need to grab your torch and pitchfork.
This also has a negative psychological effect on both parties. The one getting canceled will probably get at least a couple of death threats which does wonders for their mental health, anxiety and maybe even depression. The cancellees on the other hand experience outbursts of anger, which isn’t good. According to Debbie Strong in the article “7 Ways Anger is Ruining Your Health”[4] she claims that anger in small bursts can improve rational thinking. But as stated earlier, mob mentality counteracts that. Strong continues with some of the negative health effects of outbursts of anger. A few of those are as follows: Increased risks of strokes and heart attacks, worsened anxiety, weakened immune system and links to depression. A very common reason for bullying is that the bully doesn’t feel great themselves so they take it out on others. So worsened anxiety and depression could be fuel for the fire of cyberbullying to continue.
Parasocial Relationships
A parasocial relationship is a relationship where only one person knows that they’re in one. This is becoming more and more common in the digital age when fans feel a personal connection to the influencers they follow. This phenomenon has been around for a long time, according to Carol Laurent Jarzyna in the article “Parasocial Interaction, the COVID-19 Quarantine, and Digital Age Media”[6] people in the nineteenth century most likely formed parasocial relationships with their favorite protagonist in a book. Parasocial relationships on their own aren’t very detrimental to your mental health, on the contrary it might actually help feelings of loneliness. But it’s the combination with other aspects of social media that can make them harmful. For example the previously mentioned herd mentality. Large groups of people feeling a personal connection to someone they have never met are easily moved by that person's words. That person then has to be very careful with their words if they don’t want to send an army out to war. Basically, parasocial relationships are the fuel for the fire that is mob mentality. 

How Different Social Medias Affect You
Sourcing this part is next to impossible due to no one really writing about the structure of different sites. Due to that it’s mostly my own conclusions. But if you asked around, this would be the general consensus.  
Twitter - Also known as the most toxic place on the internet and that few actually seem to like. Why is that? Well it’s where the most cyberbullying takes place. It’s here that most problems I have touched on apply the most. 
Facebook - Once the biggest social media, now just a hollow husk of its former glory. Because of how big it was 10-15 years ago, it’s only those who used it back then who still use it. That makes it so Facebook has a significantly older userbase than most other social media.  While on the surface Facebook only seems to suffer the standard social media issues such as the infinite scroll taking up an endless amount of time and the inferiority complex you develop while looking at how great others' lives are compared to yours, Facebook suffers a much deeper problem. That being the groups you can join. Instead of like on Twitter where you shout into the void and sometimes the void shouts back, here you can search to find groups of like minded individuals. Most of the time this is harmless, such as old guys sharing their biggest catch in a fishing group, but in the past few years this has caused some serious problems. The modern anti-vaxx movement as well as the flat earthers and maybe even the storming of the capitol last year was only possible due to these groups, the last being supported by Wong. 
The older generations are also a lot more gullible online. Look no further than how often they’re targeted in phone scams. This makes it so if they see someone post that earth is flat they’re more likely to believe it than a teenager for example. And I don’t think I need to explain that being anti-vaxx may harm your health. Maybe they get healthier from polio than they would be otherwise.
Reddit - Basically suffers the same problems as Facebook, but for younger people. The main gimmick of Reddit is the ability to create subreddits. Smaller groups where you can share your interests. The difference from Facebook is that the issue here does not lie in the people but in the site’s structure. On reddit you can upvote or downvote posts (like or dislike). More upvotes, more karma (number in your profile). The general rule of the internet is “bigger number, better person”. Whether it be likes on Twitter or views on Youtube, you always want more. On reddit, where the groups are more focused you always need to do something a little more extreme than the last to gain a few more upvotes. Usually this just makes it so people post the same things over and over again, because they get upvotes which releases chemicals in our brains which rewards us. The bigger problem lies in the more extreme subreddits. Most get banned after a while but they can destroy people's interpretation of the world around them. There have been subreddits dedicated to rape, abusing women and self mutilation. A lot of children use reddit so imagine what could happen if a child stumbled across a subreddit like that. Nothing good I tell you.
Youtube & Twitch - These platforms affect you very differently depending on how you use them. If you just watch content on these platforms there are no really unique consequences. They do take up a lot of time, because of the longer form content. This is also why these platforms are slowly dying. Our attention span is slowly degrading due to shorter form content like on Tiktok and the infinite scroll of many platforms. 
If you actually create something on these platforms on the other hand to any extent but especially if you do it professionally, you’re in for a ride. Due to the ever shifting environment of the internet you may be out of a job from one day to the next which can lead to anxiety. You have no security like a pension for example. Every single company on earth could come for you at any moment with an unjust copyright claim that you can do nothing about. The sites may say they let you be you, but it’s probably the only media form that forces it’s creatives to make a certain kind of content. They simply won’t promote something that breaks the mold.
Interview Results
During my interviews with two informants, a 48 woman and a 16 year old man they had differing opinions on the effects of social media. The older woman argued that social media was a force for good that could be used for seeking information and was a great place for job opportunities. (She works partly with hiring new workers for her workplace). On the other hand the younger man argued similarly to what I have proposed in this essay. He wasn’t the biggest fan to say the least. While neither wanted to say they were an active user of social media, the younger man was more in the know of the bigger picture than the older woman. He also was on social media 5 times as long as her every day.

In conclusion, social media isn’t great. While there are good things about it, overall it doesn’t do you any wonders. I would’ve loved to have touched on more issues, such as the problems with anonymity, inferiority complexes and the infinite scroll but this can’t go on forever. There are a lot more topics to cover, I just chose some of the lesser touched on by most to maybe make you learn something new. You could have this exact same topic and write about completely different things. It’s that wide. But not using social media nowadays is almost impossible, such as for my older informant who has it as part of her job. I didn’t realize how similar many social medias were when I started this, which is a thing I see now. 
What I want you to take away from this is that maybe you should put down your phone every once in a while and reflect on what you’re doing. Maybe you don’t need to drag someone's face through the mud because they criticized your favorite streamer. Go outside, touch some grass.
