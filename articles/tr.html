					<p>Transgender Civil Rights

The rights of transgender individuals have been a hot topic lately. Both in mostly American news as well as everywhere on social media you see some new controversy and/or horrible event regarding the topic.

History Around the World
The trans civil right movement is relatively more recent than others, though trans people have existed all through history. According to the article “How Historians are Documenting the Lives of Transgender People” by Erin Blakemore, National Geographic (22/6 2022) the term transgender didn’t exist until the 1960’s but the concept has been around since ancient times. The first big transgender icon was Christine Jorgensen, a veteran who after she transitioned in 1952 became a public figure.
Early examples of people challenging gender norms exist all around the world. In ancient Rome, Sumer, Akkadia and Greece, there were priests who were assigned male at birth but identified as women in their worship of a variety of goddesses. In south Asia there were the Hijira, a group of nonbinary people. In North America, the indigenous population had a third gender in two-spirits.
There was even a transgender Roman emperor, Elagabalus in the early third century. This wasn’t very well received, so she was assassinated at the age of 18.
During the american civil war there were at least 250 people who even though they were assigned female at birth fought as men. One of these was Albert Cashier who even though he fought in over 40 battles and was defended by his comrades was confined to a mental asylum decades later and was forced to wear feminine clothing.
When medical procedures advanced during the 20th century so did the possibilities for transgender people. Now gender confirmation surgery was possible, after some problems such as the death of the first patients, Lili Elbe who died in a failed surgery.
Jorgensen, who the article mentioned in the beginning, became such a media sensation that she couldn’t get a job except for self-promotion.

It was in the mid 20th century that the movement for actual acceptance by society for trans people started after the police had been targeting trans women in random arrests, they responded with throwing donuts at the officers. This was the first in a long series of protests, demonstrations and riots where not even the LGBTQIA+ community always were on their sides, such as trans activists being booed off the stage at the 1973 Pride Parade. But after a long fight against laws that forbid them from marrying and discrimination it brings us to today.
In 1999 Monica Helms designed the icon of transgender people all around the world, the trans flag. The pink and blue stripes symbolize typical gender norms with the white being for transitioning, intersex as well as nonbinary.

History in Sweden
So how does this compare to Swedish history? Well according to the article “Transhistoria” by Transammans the movement really began in 1962. Of course gender norm breaking individuals have always existed but this was the first time it was a collective, that being the club Transvestia. Then in 1966 the group Full Personality Expression Sweden was founded. In 1972 we were the first country in the world to allow people to change their legal gender as well as allowing certain surgeries and hormone treatments.
In 1979, the patients association Benjamin was founded, being the first organization for transgender people. The national federation for LGBTQIA+ individuals, RFSL included trans people in their 2001 statement. The transgender day of remembrance was noticed for the first time in Sweden 2007, a day to remember the murders and crimes committed against them for their identity. In 2009 hate speech against transgender people were included as a basis for discrimination as well as removing transvestism as a mental disorder.
During the 2010’s the care for transitioning individuals improved greatly such as establishing care for nonbinary people as well as standardizing treatment across the country.
In 2012, trans children between the ages of 12 and 18 could have any name they wanted as long as their caretakers agreed to it. It was also changed so that you no longer needed to be sterilized if you wanted to change your gender. The following years would include a lot of compensation for people who were sterilized against their will. In 2017 a proposition was laid forth to improve the life of trans individuals as well as changing the name law to include children under the age of 12.
Finally in 2018 trans people were recognized by the Swedish constitution as they were included in the legislation against hate crimes. This was less of a parallel to the other history and more of a continuation, that’s because the fight looked more or less alike all around the western world at least

My Own Thoughts
Saying all this, you’d think that most of discrimination would be a thing of the past now right? Wrong. There’s an entire site of just anti-trans legislations and bills in the US, https://translegislation.com/ so that should tell you something. A recent movement mainly among the right wing conservatives in the US has tried to paint transgender people as pedophiles and groomers. That they’re not their preferred gender. Even calling them violent maniacs because 3 of the 2600 school shooters in the past 5 years didn’t identify as the gender they were assigned at birth. 
There’s also the TERF movement, women who were assigned female at birth who claim that trans women erase “real” women’s suffering as well as the usual transphobic rhetoric. All the while making trans people suffer a much worse fate in the process. Chief among them is the Harry Potter author J.K Rowling who over the past few years has radicalized into what many consider to be THE transphobe.
Other notable transphobes include many right wing american personalities such as Jordan B. Peterson and Ben Shapiro, but the one I consider to be the most heinous has to be Matt Walsh. He said that killing and erasing every trans person wouldn’t be considered a genocide because trans people aren’t people. (https://www.rollingstone.com/politics/politics-news/cpac-speaker-transgender-people-eradicated-1234690924/ ). His other famous quote is about how women “are the most fertile at age 16”, so yeah all around bad person.
If all that stuff wasn’t enough, so has the infighting in the LGBTQIA+ community not stopped. As I mentioned before, transgender people were booed off the stage during the first pride parade. Nowadays there are some LGBTQIA+ individuals who have bought into the vile hatred spewed towards transgender people so they want to cut them out of the community, acting like they themselves aren’t next on the chopping block for the right wing extremists.

There are multiple transgender people just here at this school so how this is present in teenagers' lives should be obvious. Our generation is much more comfortable in exploring our gender identity than previous ones overall. It’s not something freaky for most of us, it’s normal.

There’s basically an endless swamp of pure vitriol all over social media right now, too much to discuss here such as the never ending bathroom debate, the “difficult pronouns” or the athletic angle. But what I just want to say is that we’re all human, we deserve at least some common decency toward each other and learning about transgender people wouldn’t prevent transphobia completely but it could at least alleviate a bit of it. And also, trans rights are human rights.

https://transammans.se/vad-ar-trans/transhistoria/ 

Transammans state on their website that they’re the biggest association for transgender people in Sweden, which means it’s most likely not a neutral source but it would give a good angle into the struggle over the years. 

https://www.nationalgeographic.com/history/article/how-historians-are-documenting-lives-of-transgender-people  
It’s National Geographic, basically every documentary you’ve ever seen has been produced by them. Their brand recognition alone makes them feel a thousand percent more trustworthy. Their size would also decrease the chance for false information to be presented on the site, someone would have noticed that.
The article itself passes all the quick tests to determine a source’s trustworthiness, like listing an author, publishing date as well as ways to contact them about the information. It also doesn’t blatantly contradict what I already knew about the subject or what other sources said.
